# My-Device-Region

This repository contain source code of iOS app "My Device Region Pro".  In June 2014 i studied Objective-C and made this app for iPhone and iPad. You can write model code of your iPhone/iPod/iPad/Mac and see for which country it's designed.  It was my first app for iOS so code quality is bad :)
